The European Parliament mission 2025 represents a comprehensive strategic framework established by the European Parliament following the 2024 European elections. This mission outlines the Parliament's vision, priorities, and objectives for the 2024-2029 legislative term, serving as a guiding document for parliamentary activities and legislative initiatives.

As the directly elected representative body of European Union citizens, the European Parliament developed this mission to address the most pressing challenges facing Europe while strengthening democratic institutions and processes across the Union.
