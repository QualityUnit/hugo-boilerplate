Fresnel Lens - The ridged, plastic lens covering the PIR sensor that focuses infrared radiation onto it, determining the sensor’s angle and range.

Full HD 1080p - A resolution of 1920×1080 pixels, a common standard in trail camera video recording.

Ghost Trigger - A false trigger that leads to empty shots, often caused by sudden temperature changes or moving vegetation that confuses the PIR sensor.
